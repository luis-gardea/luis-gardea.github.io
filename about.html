        <h1>About me...</h1>
        <p class="lead">My name is <b>Luis Gardea</b> and I am a sophomore at <b>Stanford University</b> pursuing a Bachelor of Science in <b>Computer Science</b>. I am from El Paso, Texas, which lies right on the border of The United States and Mexico, neighboring the notorious city of Juarez. I have very broad interests ranging from music and playing the guitar to video games and PC gaming to watching movies from esteemed Mexican directors to playing Ultimate Frisbee with friends.<br><br>

        I am hoping to spend this upcoming summer working as a <b>Software Engineering Intern</b> at a technology company. My classes at Stanford have greatly sparked my interest in computer programming and software. Having taken CS 106A (<b>Programming Methodology</b>) and CS 106B (<b>Programming Abstractions</b>), I have gained experience with object-oriented programming in Java and C++, as well as familiarity and understanding of several algorithms as well as data structures. Other classes such as CS 109 (<b>Computer Science Probability</b>) and CS 103 (<b>Mathematical Foundations of Computing</b>), in which I am currently enrolled, have taught me to enjoy the mathematical background of computer science, as well as the way of thinking that programming requires. I am also currently enrolled in CS 107 (<b>Computer Organization and Systems</b>), which deals with low level programming in C, and delves into computer architecture and assembly.<br><br> 

        My previous summer position was in IT Operations at the <b>El Paso Electric Company</b>, where I had much experience in administrating several aspects of the company as well as interacting with various other members, in different areas, of the company. This gave me the opportunity to see the different ways in which companies operate, but it also directed my interests toward a more software engineering based career. I have also conducted research in Chemistry for the <b>University of Texas at El Paso</b> during two summers, where I obtained new insight into how the scientific method is implemented in actuality and was able to learn how to operate complex machinery and carry out sensitive chemical reactions over the course of a total of 640 hours.
