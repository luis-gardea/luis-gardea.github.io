I am currently a Software Engineer at Zoox, where we are working to develop the future of autonomous vehicles and mobility in complex urban environments. You can learn more about our mission and how you could join us [here](https://zoox.com/). Formerly, I was a Software Engineer at Fitbit, as a member of the Fitbit Coach Platform Team, where I got to build Ruby and Go APIs and microservices. I attended Stanford University for my undergraduate education, completing a B.S. in Computer Science.

I have many interests within software, tech, and CS, not limited to machine learning and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, scalability, and applied math. I am also interested in the value of software and technology to do social good.

Outside of work, I have a wide range of interests not limited to music, basketball, photography, building things (the physical kind), and mechanical watches.
