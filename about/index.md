I am currently a Software Engineer for Fitbit, as a member of the Fitbit Coach Platform Team, where I get to build and maintain Ruby and Go APIs and microservices. I attended Stanford University for my undergraduate education, completing a B.S. in Computer Science.

I have many interests within software engineering and computer science, not limited to machine learning and artificial intelligence, scalability, microservice architectures, algorithms and applied math. I am also interested in the value of software and technology to do social good.

Outside of work, I have a wide range of interests not limited to music, basketball, photography, building things (the physical kind), and mechanical watches.
