I am currently working as a Software Engineer for Fitbit as a member of the Fitbit Coach Platform Team, where I work with Ruby and Go microservices on a daily basis. I attended Stanford University for my undergraduate education, completing a B.S. in Computer Science.

I have many interests within software engineering and computer science, not limited to machine learning and artificial intelligence, scalability, microservice architectures, algorithms and CS applied math. I am always looking to learn more about topics where my knowledge is limited.

Outside of academics, I have a wide range of other interests. Music is a great passion of mine; I love listening to and playing the guitar. As a side project during college, I built my own electric guitar at Stanford's PRL woodshop. I am also a mechanical watch enthusiast, as I really appreciate good engineering and design.
