Currently a senior at **Stanford University**, I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in **Computer Science**. I am from El Paso, Texas, which lies right on the border of The United States and Mexico. After graduation, I will begin working as a Software Engineer at **Fitbit** on their **Fitstar** team. 

My interests within computer science were sparked when I started college and currently I have found very strong interests and enjoyment in math applied to computer science. I have taken and loved the following Stanford courses in computer architecture (**CS 107**), systems (**CS 110**), computer science probability and math (**CS 109, CS 103**), web apps (**CS 142**), algorithms (**CS 161**), mathematical methods for computer vision, graphics, and robotics (**CS 205A**), machine learning (**CS 229**), artificial intelligence (**CS 221**), computer graphics (**CS 148**), computer vision (**CS 131**), and linear dynamical systems (**EE 263**). 

Outside of academics, I have a wide range of other interests. Music is one of my passions; I love listening to music of all genres and ages, and I love live music. I have been fortunate to take music classes at Stanford - music theory (**Music 19A**) and music cognition (**Music 1A**). I love playing the guitar, as well as the hardware aspect that goes with electric guitar - as a side project, in the Winter of 2015, I built my own electric guitar at the woodshop of Stanford's PRL.
